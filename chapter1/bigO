Big O establishes a worst-case run time

Some common Big O run times
1. O(log n), also known as log time. Example: Binary search
2. O(n), also known as linear time. Example: Simple search
3. O(n * log n). Example: A fast sorting algorithm, like quicksort
4. O(n*n). Example: A slow sorting algorithm, like selection sort
5. O(n!). Example: A really slow algorithm, like the traveling
   salesperson
